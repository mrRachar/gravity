## What?
A library and application to allow the 3-D simulation of massive objects through gravitational fields.
It is designed to be highly extensible, and any part of it can be easily changed programmatically:

 * You want a different G value? Sure thing
 * You want multiple gravitational fields? Sure, I guess, but why not just change the G value...
 * You want to create you own kinds of mechanical fields? Definitely *(Just extend Field)*
 * You want a nice interactive GUI in which you can do all of this. Of course!
 
## How to use?

You'll need Python 3.6+ *(yes, 3.6)*, and matplotlib installed. I haven't tried it on a Mac, but I believe
it should work fine on a Windows or Linux machine (tkinter on Mac works a little differently).
To run it just run `main.py`.
 
## Progress
Simulating is fine. The GUI works,and simulations such as the earth and the moon work, and graph, fine. 
It's not everything I planned, but it works well.
