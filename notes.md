Started working on the project, looking at the mechanics of it

## 16th of January

With almost all of the mechanics working, I am now working on the graph to

underdocumented and causing some problems

## 30th of January

With some time lost due to focus on other activities *(Chemisty Olympiad
and Robotics)*, I am now getting back to working on **matplotlib**.
