## 9th of January
Started working on the project, looking at the mechanics of it

## 16th of January

With almost all of the mechanics working, I am now working on the graph to
make sure I can get **matplotlib** to work well in 3D. It is a *little*
underdocumented and causing some problems

## 30th of January

With some time lost due to focus on other activities *(Chemisty Olympiad
and Robotics)*, I am now getting back to working on **matplotlib**.

## 6th of Feburary *(Birthday)*

The graph is working well, but it seems that gravity is not working
anywhere near as well as it should, maybe the force directions are wrong?
The problems are either with the forces or the gravity calculation.
